{"name":"Haythserv-2","tagline":"HaythServ-v2 - Fast - Powerful - Lightweight","body":"# HaythServ-2\r\n## Fast - Powerful - Lightweight\r\n\r\nHaythServ-2 is designed to be fast and powerful, but also to be able to run on very weak machines. I remade the original HaythServ, without basing this new mod on anything else, it's written in pure C++, and that makes it be more powerful, because what you can't do in Lua (Lua was used in HaythServ very much), you can do that in C++. There's still a lot to do and this mod is under deep development.\r\n\r\n## Still to-do\r\n\r\nThere's still a lot to do in HaythServ-2, here's a small list of main-features which I'm gonna add in the next stable version:\r\n\r\n* C++ External modules which may be un-/re-/loaded without any restart.\r\n* Some more player commands, like #cw or #votekick.\r\n* #whois player command to check all names used by an IP-Address/IP-Range.\r\n* Anti-cheat.\r\n\r\nOther features that I'm gonna add somewhen:\r\n\r\n* IRC bot.\r\n* Total player statistics.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nYou can download HaythServ-2 [here](http://162.220.10.113/wiki/index.php?title=Download). You can also just git clone the HaythServ/HaythServ-2 repository...\r\n\r\n## Current features\r\n\r\n* Root privilege level, to share common admin privileges with friends, but keeping highest privileges for yourself.\r\n* C++ Player commands.\r\n* Accounting system.\r\n* Flagruns system.\r\n* Rename command.\r\n* Stats command. \r\n\r\n## Wiki\r\n\r\nAs promised, I added a wiki where you can see how to install / configure HaythServ-2 and much more things about it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
